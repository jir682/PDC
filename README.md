# PDC

A program for working with permutations and parabolic double cosets in symmetric groups. Based on the theory developed in the following paper: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00736](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00736). This code was written for the Algebraic Combinatorics group of the Washington Experimental Mathematics Lab (WXML) in winter - spring 2018.

## Functionality

Currently, this program can:

* Compute the number of parabolic double cosets in S_n whose minimal element is a given permutation
* Compute the number of parabolic double cosets in S_n
* Find the minimal and maximal elements of a parabolic double coset
* Compute the lex-maximal presentation of a parabolic double coset (in interval form)
* Determine whether two permutations are related in Bruhat order
* Determine whether a Bruhat interval is a parabolic double coset
* Compute the rank and cardinality of a parabolic double coset
* Find all reduced expressions for a permutation
* Compute and draw w-oceans
